The College Management System is a web application based on Django Framework that incorporates three different login types: admin login, student login, and HR login. The admin login allows administrators to access and manage student and employee details. Additionally, admins possess the authority to create new admin user accounts. Students can log in using their username and password in the student login section. If a student is new to the application, they can sign up and subsequently log in. Once logged in, students can view their timetable, academic calendar, and events calendar. They also have the option to provide feedback on their teachers, which is stored in the backend database. Furthermore, students can upload files such as assignments within the web application. HR department members can log in using their specific credentials in the HR login section. Upon logging in, they are directed to the home page, where they can choose the type of view for average teacher ratings. The application offers both tabular form and pie chart views. In the tabular form view, clicking on a teacher name reveals all the students and their respective ratings for that teacher. In the pie chart view, a comparison of the average ratings of teachers can be observed.
